# Requirements
## Introduction
 *  During exams, the students are facing a lot of difficulties while finding the books which they require to study for their exams. As the numbers of books are increasing so it becomes a tedious task to find the location of the books as well as whether the book is available or not, and most of the students issue way before exams and don't return it even after return date and so other students don't get books during exams.
 *  Thus, the motive behind this project to ensure that the system is working properly, one can find the location of the book easily, availability, newly arrivals and also one can book a ticket if it is already issued by another person, the status of the book, fine imposed on students for due submissions and registration for new students.
